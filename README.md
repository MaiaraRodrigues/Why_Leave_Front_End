# **Why Leave?**

## **About Project**

An interactive map of the world with the ability to see what's going on in specific countries in terms of human rights, abuses and to find information regarding why people are actually leaving their home countries.

This repository is a frontend to this project [here](https://github.com/Joshuamac2/Why-leave-backend).

Pulling information from the backend API project, this web application will display interactive markers on a map according to a list of [UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/emergencies.html) emergency status countries.

You can visit the web app [here](https://why-leave.vercel.app/)
